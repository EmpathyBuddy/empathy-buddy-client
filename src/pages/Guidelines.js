            <h4>What supports someone requesting emapthy?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Empathy means holding PRESENCE with as close to 100% attention as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                The listener is aware that no matter what the speaker is saying, the listener does not believe or disbelieve the story. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Agree on a time limit that feels comfortable for both.
                </li>
                <li>
                Only at the end of the agreed upon time, the speaker may ask for advise, education, reassurance, sympathy, etc. and the Empathy Buddy can respond if they are moved to.
                </li>
                <li>
                Agree that during our empathy time each of us will hold the intention of not responding from one of the empathy blockers you will find below.
                </li>

                <li>Educating: "This could turn into a positive experience if you just...."</li>
                <li>Advising: "I think you should..."</li>
