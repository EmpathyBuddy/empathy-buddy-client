# EmpathyBuddy

EmpathyBuddy is a platform where you can give and receive empathy. It creates a space in daily life to request empathic listening, which is well established among people initiated in Non Violent Communication. The concept is simple: two people agree on a time limit, and one of them offers the gift of their full presence through empathic listening. There is no judgment or back-and-forth talking; there is only empathy. This application provides a global platform where people can connect instantly.

This repository contains the frontend implementation of the EmpathyBuddy application, built with React, Bootstrap, and PicoCss. The repository for the backend (REST API) can be found [here](https://github.com/EmpathyBuddy/empathy-buddy-server).
